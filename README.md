Usually found sitting around friends or being AFK, so if you want to stop by and talk to me, feel free!
When I know I'll be away for a long time I'll change my skin name to something like " W2i playing [insert game here]" or whatever.

  I don't have much to say but you can talk with me if you'd like! Whisper me just incase to catch my attention though.
  I'm very friendly and I love sitting with others! You can come sit with me or behind me whenever you'd like, I try to be online everyday.

### <ins> **__DO NOT INTERACT__** </ins>

I keep this list fairly short, just do not be weird, gross or rude to any of my friends. Please do not copy skins either unless you ask me for some help or what exactly i used for my cosplays!
Also DNI if you are under 16, are homophobic/transphobic, and are just a generally rude and dry person. I like keeping my circles nice and positive!


> [!WARNING]
> Drama starters will be swiftly blocked or hidden, as for uncomfortable skins.
